Which elements of replication rely on specific protein-DNA interaction?
  Termination sometimes
  Most things involved in initiation are non-specific
Which elements of replication rely on non-specific protein-DNA interactions?
  Helicase
  DNA polymerase
  anything involved in elongation
Double helix can be rotated and translated away from the norm which will affect interactions
There are also intrinsic bends within the DNA which will also change how things interact with the double helix
Common protein-DNA interaction themes
  A couple dozen h-bonds at the surface of the protein sufficient for specificity for DNA binding
  DNA binding is largely a matter of complementary surfaces
  Most well-characterized binding proteins are dimers (generally homodimers
  Some do interact with the minor groove
  conformations of each molecule can be altered by the interaction
There are common modes of recognition, but no simple code
  no 1:1 correspondence between side chains and bases
Indirect readout
  helical twist of non-contacted base pairs determines the affinity

Replication
  Bacterial chromosome replication
    initiated at oriC [GFP(Green Fluorescent Protein)] 
    Stopped at terminator
    Initially thought that replication is always middle of the cell and needs its factory, but in fact not true
