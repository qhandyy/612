Which elements of replication rely on specific protein-DNA interaction?
  Termination sometimes
  Most things involved in initiation are non-specific
Which elements of replication rely on non-specific protein-DNA interactions?
  Helicase
  DNA polymerase
  anything involved in elongation
Double helix can be rotated and translated away from the norm which will affect interactions
There are also intrinsic bends within the DNA which will also change how things interact with the double helix
Common protein-DNA interaction themes
  A couple dozen h-bonds at the surface of the protein sufficient for specificity for DNA binding
  DNA binding is largely a matter of complementary surfaces
  Most well-characterized binding proteins are dimers (generally homodimers
  Some do interact with the minor groove
  conformations of each molecule can be altered by the interaction
There are common modes of recognition, but no simple code
  no 1:1 correspondence between side chains and bases
Indirect readout
  helical twist of non-contacted base pairs determines the affinity

Replication
  Bacterial chromosome replication
    initiated at oriC [GFP(Green Fluorescent Protein)] 
    Stopped at terminator
    Initially thought that replication is always middle of the cell and needs its factory, but in fact not true

How to find the origin?
  Insert ori onto plasmid with antibiotic resistance gene and select for it on selective medium
  DUE - DNA unwinding element... where DNA splits for replication
  1. DnaA binds DnaA boxes
  2. ATP DnaA's oligomerize, promote unwinding and recruit helicase + loader complex
  3. 2 DnaB hexomers loaded onto DUE DnaC dissociates
  4. Replisome Asssembly Begins
Rep initiation and regulation
  Physical - opening duplex to access DNA needs to be regulated
  Coordinate with the cell cycle to have replication occur at the right time and that the correct amount of replication is occurring
  Steps leading to ori
    DnaA boxes fill first
    Bending proteins IHF and Fis modulate DNA binding
    high-affinity bound DnaA recruits DnaA to low affinity sites
    DnaA extends to DUE and recruits DnaB
  Regulatory inactivation of DnaA prevents over-intiations
  DnaA box VII motif is necessary for DnaA function
  HDA box VII motif is homologous to above
  RIDA inhibits DnaA avtivity by sequestering DnaAs oligomerization domain - inactivating the recruitment of DnaB
Termination
  Tus/Ter complex
    monomeric
    permissive and non-permissive faces
      Permissive allows passage of fork
      Non-permissive doesn't allow passage
        prevents fork from going bakcwards
    crystal structure with 15bP core sequence of TerA
